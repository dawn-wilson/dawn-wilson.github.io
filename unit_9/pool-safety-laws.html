				<h4>THE IMPORTANCE OF POOL SAFETY</h4>
				<p>As of 30th November 2015, every pool owner must ensure their pool complies with the <a href="files/QDCMP3.4SwimmingPoolBarriers.pdf" type="application/pdf;" title="QDCMP 3.4 Swimming Pool Barriers" target="_blank">Pool Safety Standard</a>. This may mean that you need an inspection, but that you need to ensure the pool barrier is compliant.</p>
				<p>For most pool owners, it is almost impossible to understand all the legislation to work out if the pool barrier complies. That is why TKP Pool Safety Inspections is here to help with.</p>
				<p>The risks of doing nothing are worth considering. Councils have the power to enter your backyard to check your pool. Should they find issues they can fine you for having a non-compliant pool barrier and for individuals it's more than $19,000. Additionally, should tragedy occur in your pool due to a non-compliant pool barrier and you are sued by family, your insurance company may not pay out.</p>

				<h4>COMPLIANCE</h4>
				<h5 class="compliance">Pool Safety Register</h5>
				<p>Most pools in Queensland have now been registered on the Queensland Government's <a href="https://www.smarteda.qld.gov.au/pools/properties/propertySearch.action" taregt="blank">Pool Safety Register</a>. The pool safety register is just one part of a range of initiatives that will help protect young people from drowning unnecessarily. The pool safety register includes a record of pools in Queensland and copies of pool safety certificates issued.</p>
				<h5 class="compliance">Buyers, Sellers, Tenants and Property Managers</h5>
				<p>Pool safety laws apply to pools associated with houses, townhouses, units, hotels, motels, backpacker hostels, homestay accommodation and caravan parks (building classes 1-4 as defined under the Building Code of Australia).</p>

				<li><a href="files/Selling_a_property_with_a_pool.pdf" type="application/pdf;" title="Selling a property with a pool" target="_blank">Selling a property with a pool</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h5 class="compliance">Pool Safety Certificates</h5>
				<p>Since 1 December 2010, pool safety certificates have been required when selling or leasing a property with a pool. Pool Safety Certificates must be obtained from a Licensed Pool Safety Inspector.</p>
				<h5 class="compliance">Requirements for CPR signs</h5>
				<p>Queensland's pool safety laws require the latest cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) sign to be displayed near your pool or spa.</p>
				<p>The CPR sign must:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>be attached to the safety barrier for the pool, or displayed near the pool, so that the sign is easily visible to a person near the pool</li>
				    <li>be at least 300 mm by 300 mm in size</li>
				    <li>be made of durable and weatherproof material</li>
				    <li>include a statement that is prominent on the sign, explaining to a person reading the sign how to act in an emergency, including for example telephoning for an ambulance, staying with the injured person, calling for help and providing first aid.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Make sure your pool complies with the latest requirements for CPR and warning signs. <a href="files/CardiopulmonaryResuscitationSignGuideline.pdf" type="application/pdf;" title="Guideline 7 - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation" target="_blank">Guideline 7 - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</a>.</p>
				<h5 class="compliance">Child Safety and Pools</h5>
				<p>Drowning is one of the main causes of death in Queensland for children under the age of 5 years old. For every young child that drowns in a pool, approximately five are hospitalised due to water immersion injuries, some of whom will suffer permanent brain damage.</p>
				<p>Parents, people supervising children and pool owners should follow the ABC of pool safety: Read the <a href="files/TheABCOfPoolSafety.pdf" type="application/pdf;" title="The ABC Of Pool Safety" target="_blank">ABC of pool safety</a> and the <a href="files/PoolSafetyDoesYourPoolPassTheTestFactSheet.pdf" type="application/pdf;" title="Does Your Pool Pass the Test Fact Sheet" target="_blank">Does your pool pass the test?</a> fact sheets.</p>
