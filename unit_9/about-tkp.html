				<h4>POOL SAFETY INSPECTIONS</h4>
				<p>If basic precautions are not put in place and safety regulations are not met, the risk of drowning increases significantly. It can be doing something as simple as, trimming away shrubs or moving furniture that is all you need to do, to make your pool safe. TKP Pool Safety Inspections is here to make it easy for you to meet safety regulations. We come to your property and make sure it's safe and complies with the current requirements.</p>
				<p>Our pool safety inspectors are licensed to carry out Pool Inspections, and will provide a pool safety certificate upon satisfactory completion of their visit. We also provide a free, pre-inspection checklist so you can get any remedial work carried out before the actual inspection. If you fail the safety inspection, we will work closely with you to get your pool up to the required standards.</p>
				<p class="final-p">If you have any questions or want more information on our services in the wider Brisbane and Gold Coast area, including Caboolture, Ipswich, the Bay Islands and down to the Tweed, please call us on 0400 581 144 or email <a href="mailto:tkmillar5@bigbond.com">tkmillar5@bigbond.com</a>.</p>
